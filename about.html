          <p>Hiâ€”I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Ottawa. While pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering I have learned and experienced various different aspects of software development, computer architecture, electrical processes, and more. Specifically, I've learned and experienced working with the following software's/programming languages: Java (most proficient), Python, C++, Android Studios, SQL, VHDL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Office, Golang, Scheme, Prolog. I also have experience working with various circuits and processors while studying at the University of Ottawa. Most recently, I have developed a keen interest in software development and the wide scope this area of expertise provides. I am currently open to experience any and all opportunities my degree provides that best fits my knowledge, skills, and interests.</p>
          <br> <br>
          <p>I'm a flexible team player who thrives in environments requiring ability to effectively prioritize and juggle concurrent projects. I'm also adaptable to changes in computer language and technology to continuously upgrade my skills. I'm patient and methodical when dealing with complex systems or coding errors and have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to make well thought out decisions.
          I am known to be tolerant and flexible in all situations as required while working with colleagues or team members as well as open minded and willing to grow through constructive feedback.</p>
          <br> <br>
          <p>I hope to find work with a company that shares my values for hard work, continuous learning, and success. I look forward to what's to come and I'm excited for the new challenges that come my way!</p>
